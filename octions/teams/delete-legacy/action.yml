  **Deprecation Notice:** This endpoint route is deprecated and will be removed from the Teams API. We recommend migrating your existing code to use the new [`Delete team`](https://developer.github.com/v3/teams/#delete-team) endpoint.  To delete a team, the authenticated user must be an organization owner or team maintainer.  If you are an organization owner, deleting a parent team will delete all of its child teams as well.
