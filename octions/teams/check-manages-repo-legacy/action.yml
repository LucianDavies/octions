name: Check if a team manages a repository (Legacy)
description: |
  **Note**: Repositories inherited through a parent team will also be checked.  **Deprecation Notice:** This endpoint route is deprecated and will be removed from the Teams API. We recommend migrating your existing code to use the new [`Check if a team manages a repository`](https://developer.github.com/v3/teams/#check-if-a-team-manages-a-repository) endpoint.  You can also get information about the specified repository, including what permissions the team grants on it, by passing the following custom [media type](https://developer.github.com/v3/media/) via the `Accept` header:
