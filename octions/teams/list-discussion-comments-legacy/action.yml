  **Deprecation Notice:** This endpoint route is deprecated and will be removed from the Teams API. We recommend migrating your existing code to use the new [`List comments`](https://developer.github.com/v3/teams/discussion_comments/#list-comments) endpoint.  List all comments on a team discussion. OAuth access tokens require the `read:discussion` [scope](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/understanding-scopes-for-oauth-apps/).
