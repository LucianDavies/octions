name: Remove team repository (Legacy)
description: |
  **Deprecation Notice:** This endpoint route is deprecated and will be removed from the Teams API. We recommend migrating your existing code to use the new [`Remove team repository`](https://developer.github.com/v3/teams/#remove-team-repository) endpoint.  If the authenticated user is an organization owner or a team maintainer, they can remove any repositories from the team. To remove a repository from a team as an organization member, the authenticated user must have admin access to the repository and must be able to see the team. NOTE: This does not delete the repository, it just removes it from the team.
