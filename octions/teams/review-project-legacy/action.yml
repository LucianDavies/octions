  **Deprecation Notice:** This endpoint route is deprecated and will be removed from the Teams API. We recommend migrating your existing code to use the new [`Review a team project`](https://developer.github.com/v3/teams/#review-a-team-project) endpoint.  Checks whether a team has `read`, `write`, or `admin` permissions for an organization project. The response includes projects inherited from a parent team.
