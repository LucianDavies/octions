name: List IdP groups in an organization
description: |
  Team synchronization is available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see [GitHub's products](https://help.github.com/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products) in the GitHub Help documentation.  List IdP groups available in an organization. You can limit your page results using the `per_page` parameter. GitHub generates a url-encoded `page` token using a cursor value for where the next page begins. For more information on cursor pagination, see "[Offset and Cursor Pagination explained](https://dev.to/jackmarchant/offset-and-cursor-pagination-explained-b89)."  The `per_page` parameter provides pagination for a list of IdP groups the authenticated user can access in an organization. For example, if the user `octocat` wants to see two groups per page in `octo-org` via cURL, it would look like this:
