name: Create a discussion (Legacy)
description: |
  **Deprecation Notice:** This endpoint route is deprecated and will be removed from the Teams API. We recommend migrating your existing code to use the new [`Create a discussion`](https://developer.github.com/v3/teams/discussions/#create-a-discussion) endpoint.  Creates a new discussion post on a team's page. OAuth access tokens require the `write:discussion` [scope](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/understanding-scopes-for-oauth-apps/).  This endpoint triggers [notifications](https://help.github.com/articles/about-notifications/). Creating content too quickly using this endpoint may result in abuse rate limiting. See "[Abuse rate limits](https://developer.github.com/v3/#abuse-rate-limits)" and "[Dealing with abuse rate limits](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/best-practices-for-integrators/#dealing-with-abuse-rate-limits)" for details.
