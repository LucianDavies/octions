  **Deprecation Notice:** This endpoint route is deprecated and will be removed from the Teams API. We recommend migrating your existing code to use the new [`Edit team`](https://developer.github.com/v3/teams/#edit-team) endpoint.  To edit a team, the authenticated user must either be an organization owner or a team maintainer.  **Note:** With nested teams, the `privacy` for parent teams cannot be `secret`.
