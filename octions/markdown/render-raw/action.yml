name: Render a Markdown document in raw mode
description: |
  You must send Markdown as plain text (using a `Content-Type` header of `text/plain` or `text/x-markdown`) to this endpoint, rather than using JSON format. In raw mode, [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) is not supported and Markdown will be rendered in plain format like a README.md file. Markdown content must be 400 KB or less.
