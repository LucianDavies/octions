name: Create a review comment reply
description: |
  Creates a reply to a review comment for a pull request. For the `comment_id`, provide the ID of the review comment you are replying to. This must be the ID of a _top-level review comment_, not a reply to that comment. Replies to replies are not supported.  This endpoint triggers [notifications](https://help.github.com/articles/about-notifications/). Creating content too quickly using this endpoint may result in abuse rate limiting. See "[Abuse rate limits](https://developer.github.com/v3/#abuse-rate-limits)" and "[Dealing with abuse rate limits](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/best-practices-for-integrators/#dealing-with-abuse-rate-limits)" for details.
