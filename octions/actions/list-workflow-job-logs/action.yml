name: List workflow job logs
description: |
  Gets a redirect URL to download a plain text file of logs for a workflow job. This link expires after 1 minute. Look for `Location:` in the response header to find the URL for the download. Anyone with read access to the repository can use this endpoint. GitHub Apps must have the `actions` permission to use this endpoint.  Call this endpoint using the `-v` flag, which enables verbose output and allows you to see the download URL in the header. To download the file into the current working directory, specify the filename using the `-o` flag.
