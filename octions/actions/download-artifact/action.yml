name: Download an artifact
description: |
  Gets a redirect URL to download an archive for a repository. This URL expires after 1 minute. Look for `Location:` in the response header to find the URL for the download. The `:archive_format` must be `zip`. Anyone with read access to the repository can use this endpoint. If the repository is private you must use an access token with the `repo` scope. GitHub Apps must have the `actions` permission to use this endpoint.  Call this endpoint using the `-v` flag, which enables verbose output and allows you to see the download URL in the header. To download the file into the current working directory, specify the filename using the `-o` flag.
