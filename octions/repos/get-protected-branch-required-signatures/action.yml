name: Get required signatures of protected branch
description: |
  Protected branches are available in public repositories with GitHub Free, and in public and private repositories with GitHub Pro, GitHub Team, and GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see [GitHub's products](https://help.github.com/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products) in the GitHub Help documentation.  When authenticated with admin or owner permissions to the repository, you can use this endpoint to check whether a branch requires signed commits. An enabled status of `true` indicates you must sign commits on this branch. For more information, see [Signing commits with GPG](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-commits-with-gpg) in GitHub Help.  **Note**: You must enable branch protection to require signed commits.
