name: Get the combined status for a specific ref
description: |
  Users with pull access in a repository can access a combined view of commit statuses for a given ref. The ref can be a SHA, a branch name, or a tag name.  The most recent status for each context is returned, up to 100. This field [paginates](https://developer.github.com/v3/#pagination) if there are over 100 contexts.  Additionally, a combined `state` is returned. The `state` is one of:  *   **failure** if any of the contexts report as `error` or `failure` *   **pending** if there are no statuses or a context is `pending` *   **success** if the latest status for all contexts is `success`
