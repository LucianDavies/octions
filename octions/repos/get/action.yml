name: Get a repository
description: |
  When you pass the `scarlet-witch-preview` media type, requests to get a repository will also return the repository's code of conduct if it can be detected from the repository's code of conduct file.  The `parent` and `source` objects are present when the repository is a fork. `parent` is the repository this repository was forked from, `source` is the ultimate source for the network.
