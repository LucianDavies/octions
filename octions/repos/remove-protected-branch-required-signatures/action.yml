description: |
  Protected branches are available in public repositories with GitHub Free, and in public and private repositories with GitHub Pro, GitHub Team, and GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see [GitHub's billing plans](https://help.github.com/articles/github-s-billing-plans) in the GitHub Help documentation.  When authenticated with admin or owner permissions to the repository, you can use this endpoint to disable required signed commits on a branch. You must enable branch protection to require signed commits.
