name: Create a hook
description: |
  Repositories can have multiple webhooks installed. Each webhook should have a unique `config`. Multiple webhooks can share the same `config` as long as those webhooks do not have any `events` that overlap.  Here's how you can create a hook that posts payloads in JSON format:

inputs:
  token:

      Token to authenticate the request
    required: true
  owner:
    description: |
      owner parameter
    required: true
  repo:
    description: |
      repo parameter
    required: true
  name:
    description: |
      Use `web` to create a webhook. Default: `web`. This parameter only accepts the value `web`.
    required: false
  config:
    description: |
      Key/value pairs to provide settings for this webhook. [These are defined below](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/hooks/#create-hook-config-params).
    required: true
  events:
    description: |
      Determines what [events](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/) the hook is triggered for.
    required: false
  active:
    description: |
      Determines if notifications are sent when the webhook is triggered. Set to `true` to send notifications.
    required: false

runs:
  using: node12
  main: index.js
