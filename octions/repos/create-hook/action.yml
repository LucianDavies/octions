name: Create a hook
description: |
  Repositories can have multiple webhooks installed. Each webhook should have a unique `config`. Multiple webhooks can share the same `config` as long as those webhooks do not have any `events` that overlap.  Here's how you can create a hook that posts payloads in JSON format:

  token:
