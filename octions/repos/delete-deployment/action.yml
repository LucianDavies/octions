name: Delete a deployment
description: |
  To ensure there can always be an active deployment, you can only delete an _inactive_ deployment. Anyone with `repo` or `repo_deployment` scopes can delete an inactive deployment.  To set a deployment as inactive, you must:  *   Create a new deployment that is active so that the system has a record of the current state, then delete the previously active deployment. *   Mark the active deployment as inactive by adding any non-successful deployment status.  For more information, see "[Create a deployment](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/deployments/#create-a-deployment)" and "[Create a deployment status](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/deployments/#create-a-deployment-status)."
