# Add a new deploy key

"Oction" is a GitHub Action that implements a single call with 
[@octokit/request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@octokit/request)
allowing easy interaction with GitHub REST APIs from your workflow.

Original documentation: https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/keys/#add-a-new-deploy-key

This action implements `POST` request to `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/keys`


# Quick start

```yaml
- uses: /@v
  id: my_step_id
  with:
    token: <token value>
    owner: <owner value>
    repo: <repo value>
    key: <key value>
- name: Print outputs
  run: |
    echo ${{ steps.my_step_id.outputs.id }}
    echo ${{ steps.my_step_id.outputs.number }}
```


# Inputs

| Name | Is required | Description |
|---|---|---|
|token|true|Token to authenticate the request
|owner|true|owner parameter
|repo|true|repo parameter
|title|false|A name for the key.
|key|true|The contents of the key.
|read_only|false|If `true`, the key will only be able to read repository contents. Otherwise, the key will be able to read and write.      Deploy keys with write access can perform the same actions as an organization member with admin access, or a collaborator on a personal repository.
