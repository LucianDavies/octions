    required: false
  repo:

    description: |
      A name for the key.
    required: false
  key:
    description: |

    required: true
  read_only:
    description: |
      If `true`, the key will only be able to read repository contents. Otherwise, the key will be able to read and write.      Deploy keys with write access can perform the same actions as an organization member with admin access, or a collaborator on a personal repository. For more information, see "[Repository permission levels for an organization](https://help.github.com/articles/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization/)" and "[Permission levels for a user account repository](https://help.github.com/articles/permission-levels-for-a-user-account-repository/)."
    required: false

runs:
  using: node12
  main: index.js
