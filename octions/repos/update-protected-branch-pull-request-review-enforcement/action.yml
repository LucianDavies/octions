name: Update pull request review enforcement of protected branch
description: |
  Protected branches are available in public repositories with GitHub Free, and in public and private repositories with GitHub Pro, GitHub Team, and GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see [GitHub's products](https://help.github.com/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products) in the GitHub Help documentation.  Updating pull request review enforcement requires admin or owner permissions to the repository and branch protection to be enabled.  **Note**: Passing new arrays of `users` and `teams` replaces their previous values.
