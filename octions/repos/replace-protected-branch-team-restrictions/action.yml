description: |
  Protected branches are available in public repositories with GitHub Free, and in public and private repositories with GitHub Pro, GitHub Team, and GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see [GitHub's billing plans](https://help.github.com/articles/github-s-billing-plans) in the GitHub Help documentation.  Replaces the list of teams that have push access to this branch. This removes all teams that previously had push access and grants push access to the new list of teams. Team restrictions include child teams.  | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                | | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | | `array` | The teams that can have push access.
