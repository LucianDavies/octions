name: List statuses for a specific ref
description: |
  Users with pull access in a repository can view commit statuses for a given ref. The ref can be a SHA, a branch name, or a tag name. Statuses are returned in reverse chronological order. The first status in the list will be the latest one.  This resource is also available via a legacy route: `GET /repos/:owner/:repo/statuses/:ref`.
