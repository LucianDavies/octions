The following fields are included in the `verification` object:  These are the possible values for `reason` in the `verification` object:  | Value                    | Description                                                                                                                       | | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | `expired_key`            | The key that made the signature is expired.                                                                                       | | `not_signing_key`        | The "signing" flag is not among the usage flags in the GPG key that made the signature.                                           | | `gpgverify_error`        | There was an error communicating with the signature verification service.                                                         | | `gpgverify_unavailable`  | The signature verification service is currently unavailable.                                                                      | | `unsigned`               | The object does not include a signature.                                                                                          | | `unknown_signature_type` | A non-PGP signature was found in the commit.                                                                                      | | `no_user`                | No user was associated with the `committer` email address in the commit.                                                          | | `unverified_email`       | The `committer` email address in the commit was associated with a user, but the email address is not verified on her/his account. | | `bad_email`              | The `committer` email address in the commit is not included in the identities of the PGP key that made the signature.             | | `unknown_key`            | The key that made the signature has not been registered with any user's account.                                                  | | `malformed_signature`    | There was an error parsing the signature.                                                                                         | | `invalid`                | The signature could not be cryptographically verified using the key whose key-id was found in the signature.                      | | `valid`                  | None of the above errors applied, so the signature is considered to be verified.                                                  |
