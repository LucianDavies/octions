name: Create an issue
description: |
  Any user with pull access to a repository can create an issue. If [issues are disabled in the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/disabling-issues/), the API returns a `410 Gone` status.  This endpoint triggers [notifications](https://help.github.com/articles/about-notifications/). Creating content too quickly using this endpoint may result in abuse rate limiting. See "[Abuse rate limits](https://developer.github.com/v3/#abuse-rate-limits)" and "[Dealing with abuse rate limits](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/best-practices-for-integrators/#dealing-with-abuse-rate-limits)" for details.
