  Find issues by state and keyword. This method returns up to 100 results [per page](https://developer.github.com/v3/#pagination).  When searching for issues, you can get text match metadata for the issue **title**, issue **body**, and issue **comment body** fields when you pass the `text-match` media type. For more details about how to receive highlighted search results, see [Text match metadata](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#text-match-metadata).  Let's say you want to find the oldest unresolved Python bugs on Windows. Your query might look something like this.  In this query, we're searching for the keyword `windows`, within any open issue that's labeled as `bug`. The search runs across repositories whose primary language is Python. Weâ€™re sorting by creation date in ascending order, so that the oldest issues appear first in the search results.
