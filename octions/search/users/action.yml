  Find users via various criteria. This method returns up to 100 results [per page](https://developer.github.com/v3/#pagination).  When searching for users, you can get text match metadata for the issue **login**, **email**, and **name** fields when you pass the `text-match` media type. For more details about highlighting search results, see [Text match metadata](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#text-match-metadata). For more details about how to receive highlighted search results, see [Text match metadata](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#text-match-metadata).  Imagine you're looking for a list of popular users. You might try out this query:  Here, we're looking at users with the name Tom.
