# Search code

"Oction" is a GitHub Action that implements a single call with 
[@octokit/request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@octokit/request)
allowing easy interaction with GitHub REST APIs from your workflow.

Original documentation: https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#search-code

This action implements `GET` request to `/search/code`


# Quick start

```yaml
- uses: /@v
  id: my_step_id
  with:
    token: <token value>
    q: <q value>
    sort: <sort value>
    order: <order value>
    per_page: <per_page value>
    page: <page value>

```


# Inputs

| Name | Is required | Description |
|---|---|---|
|token|true|Token to authenticate the request
|q|true|The query contains one or more search keywords and qualifiers. Qualifiers allow you to limit your search to specific areas of GitHub. The REST API supports the same qualifiers as GitHub.com. To learn more about the format of the query, see [Constructing a search query](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#constructing-a-search-query). See "[Searching code](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-code/)" for a detailed list of qualifiers.
|sort|true|Sorts the results of your query. Can only be `indexed`, which indicates how recently a file has been indexed by the GitHub search infrastructure. Default: [best match](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#ranking-search-results)
|order|true|Determines whether the first search result returned is the highest number of matches (`desc`) or lowest number of matches (`asc`). This parameter is ignored unless you provide `sort`.
|per_page|true|Results per page (max 100)
|page|true|Page number of the results to fetch.

# Outputs

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
|id|`id` field of the response (if exists)|
|number|`number` field of the response (if exists)|
