name: Search code

  Find file contents via various criteria. This method returns up to 100 results [per page](https://developer.github.com/v3/#pagination).  When searching for code, you can get text match metadata for the file **content** and file **path** fields when you pass the `text-match` media type. For more details about how to receive highlighted search results, see [Text match metadata](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#text-match-metadata).  **Note:** You must [authenticate](https://developer.github.com/v3/#authentication) to search for code across all public repositories.  **Considerations for code search**  Due to the complexity of searching code, there are a few restrictions on how searches are performed:  *   Only the _default branch_ is considered. In most cases, this will be the `master` branch. *   Only files smaller than 384 KB are searchable. *   You must always include at least one search term when searching source code. For example, searching for [`language:go`](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=language%3Ago&type=Code) is not valid, while [`amazing language:go`](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=amazing+language%3Ago&type=Code) is.  Suppose you want to find the definition of the `addClass` function inside [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery). Your query would look something like this:  Here, we're searching for the keyword `addClass` within a file's contents. We're making sure that we're only looking in files where the language is JavaScript. And we're scoping the search to the `repo:jquery/jquery` repository.

      The query contains one or more search keywords and qualifiers. Qualifiers allow you to limit your search to specific areas of GitHub. The REST API supports the same qualifiers as GitHub.com. To learn more about the format of the query, see [Constructing a search query](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#constructing-a-search-query). See "[Searching code](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-code/)" for a detailed list of qualifiers.
    required: true
  sort:
    description: |
      Sorts the results of your query. Can only be `indexed`, which indicates how recently a file has been indexed by the GitHub search infrastructure. Default: [best match](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#ranking-search-results)
    required: true
  order:
