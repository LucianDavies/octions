description: |
  Find labels in a repository with names or descriptions that match search keywords. Returns up to 100 results [per page](https://developer.github.com/v3/#pagination).  When searching for labels, you can get text match metadata for the label **name** and **description** fields when you pass the `text-match` media type. For more details about how to receive highlighted search results, see [Text match metadata](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#text-match-metadata).  Suppose you want to find labels in the `linguist` repository that match `bug`, `defect`, or `enhancement`. Your query might look like this:  The labels that best match for the query appear first in the search results.
