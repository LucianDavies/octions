name: Search commits
description: |
  Find commits via various criteria. This method returns up to 100 results [per page](https://developer.github.com/v3/#pagination).  When searching for commits, you can get text match metadata for the **message** field when you provide the `text-match` media type. For more details about how to receive highlighted search results, see [Text match metadata](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#text-match-metadata).  **Considerations for commit search**  Only the _default branch_ is considered. In most cases, this will be the `master` branch.  Suppose you want to find commits related to CSS in the [octocat/Spoon-Knife](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife) repository. Your query would look something like this:

inputs:
  token:

  q:

      The query contains one or more search keywords and qualifiers. Qualifiers allow you to limit your search to specific areas of GitHub. The REST API supports the same qualifiers as GitHub.com. To learn more about the format of the query, see [Constructing a search query](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#constructing-a-search-query). See "[Searching commits](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-commits/)" for a detailed list of qualifiers.
