name: Mark as read
description: |
  Marks a notification as "read" removes it from the [default view on GitHub](https://github.com/notifications). If the number of notifications is too large to complete in one request, you will receive a `202 Accepted` status and GitHub will run an asynchronous process to mark notifications as "read." To check whether any "unread" notifications remain, you can use the [List your notifications](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/notifications/#list-your-notifications) endpoint and pass the query parameter `all=false`.
