name: Get a thread subscription
description: |
  This checks to see if the current user is subscribed to a thread. You can also [get a repository subscription](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/watching/#get-a-repository-subscription).  Note that subscriptions are only generated if a user is participating in a conversation--for example, they've replied to the thread, were **@mentioned**, or manually subscribe to a thread.
