name: Create a content attachment
description: |
  Creates an attachment under a content reference URL in the body or comment of an issue or pull request. Use the `id` of the content reference from the [`content_reference` event](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#contentreferenceevent) to create an attachment.  The app must create a content attachment within six hours of the content reference URL being posted. See "[Using content attachments](https://developer.github.com/apps/using-content-attachments/)" for details about content attachments.  You must use an [installation access token](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps/#authenticating-as-an-installation) to access this endpoint.  This example creates a content attachment for the domain `https://errors.ai/`.
