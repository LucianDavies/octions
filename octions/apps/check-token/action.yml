name: Check a token
description: |
  OAuth applications can use a special API method for checking OAuth token validity without exceeding the normal rate limits for failed login attempts. Authentication works differently with this particular endpoint. You must use [Basic Authentication](https://developer.github.com/v3/auth#basic-authentication) to use this endpoint, where the username is the OAuth application `client_id` and the password is its `client_secret`. Invalid tokens will return `404 NOT FOUND`.
