name: Get a single GitHub App
description: |
  **Note**: The `:app_slug` is just the URL-friendly name of your GitHub App. You can find this on the settings page for your GitHub App (e.g., `https://github.com/settings/apps/:app_slug`).  If the GitHub App you specify is public, you can access this endpoint without authenticating. If the GitHub App you specify is private, you must authenticate with a [personal access token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/) or an [installation access token](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps/#authenticating-as-an-installation) to access this endpoint.
