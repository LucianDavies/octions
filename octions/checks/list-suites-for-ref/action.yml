name: List check suites for a specific ref
description: |
  **Note:** The Checks API only looks for pushes in the repository where the check suite or check run were created. Pushes to a branch in a forked repository are not detected and return an empty `pull_requests` array and a `null` value for `head_branch`.  Lists check suites for a commit `ref`. The `ref` can be a SHA, branch name, or a tag name. GitHub Apps must have the `checks:read` permission on a private repository or pull access to a public repository to list check suites. OAuth Apps and authenticated users must have the `repo` scope to get check suites in a private repository.
