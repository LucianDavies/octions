name: Update a check run
description: |
  **Note:** The Checks API only looks for pushes in the repository where the check suite or check run were created. Pushes to a branch in a forked repository are not detected and return an empty `pull_requests` array.  Updates a check run for a specific commit in a repository. Your GitHub App must have the `checks:write` permission to edit check runs.
