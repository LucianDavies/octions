name: Create a check suite
description: |
  **Note:** The Checks API only looks for pushes in the repository where the check suite or check run were created. Pushes to a branch in a forked repository are not detected and return an empty `pull_requests` array and a `null` value for `head_branch`.  By default, check suites are automatically created when you create a [check run](https://developer.github.com/v3/checks/runs/). You only need to use this endpoint for manually creating check suites when you've disabled automatic creation using "[Set preferences for check suites on a repository](https://developer.github.com/v3/checks/suites/#set-preferences-for-check-suites-on-a-repository)". Your GitHub App must have the `checks:write` permission to create check suites.
