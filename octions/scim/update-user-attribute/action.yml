name: Update a user attribute
description: |
  Allows you to change a provisioned user's individual attributes. To change a user's values, you must provide a specific `Operations` JSON format that contains at least one of the `add`, `remove`, or `replace` operations.  The following example shows adding a new email address and updating the user's given name. For other examples and more information on the SCIM operations format, see the [SCIM specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7644#section-3.5.2).  **Note:** Complicated SCIM `path` selectors that include filters are not supported. For example, a `path` selector defined as `"path": "emails[type eq \"work\"]"` will not work.  **Warning:** If you set `active:false` using the `replace` operation (as shown in the JSON example below), it removes the user from the organization, deletes the external identity, and deletes the associated `:scim_user_id`.  ``` {   "Operations":[{     "op":"replace",     "value":{       "active":false     }   }] }  ```
