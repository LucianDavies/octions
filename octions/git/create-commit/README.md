## Docs

Original documentation: https://developer.github.com/v3/git/commits/#create-a-commit

Creates a new Git [commit object](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Internals-Git-Objects#Commit-Objects).

In this example, the payload of the signature would be:



**Signature verification object**

The response will include a `verification` object that describes the result of verifying the commit's signature. The following fields are included in the `verification` object:

These are the possible values for `reason` in the `verification` object:

| Value                    | Description                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `expired_key`            | The key that made the signature is expired.                                                                                       |
| `not_signing_key`        | The "signing" flag is not among the usage flags in the GPG key that made the signature.                                           |
| `gpgverify_error`        | There was an error communicating with the signature verification service.                                                         |
| `gpgverify_unavailable`  | The signature verification service is currently unavailable.                                                                      |
| `unsigned`               | The object does not include a signature.                                                                                          |
| `unknown_signature_type` | A non-PGP signature was found in the commit.                                                                                      |
| `no_user`                | No user was associated with the `committer` email address in the commit.                                                          |
| `unverified_email`       | The `committer` email address in the commit was associated with a user, but the email address is not verified on her/his account. |
| `bad_email`              | The `committer` email address in the commit is not included in the identities of the PGP key that made the signature.             |
| `unknown_key`            | The key that made the signature has not been registered with any user's account.                                                  |
| `malformed_signature`    | There was an error parsing the signature.                                                                                         |
| `invalid`                | The signature could not be cryptographically verified using the key whose key-id was found in the signature.                      |
| `valid`                  | None of the above errors applied, so the signature is considered to be verified.                                                  |

## Quick start

```yaml
- uses: maxkomarychev/octions/octions/git/create-commit@master
  id: my_step_id
  with:
    token: <token value>
    message: <message value>
    tree: <tree value>
    parents: <parents value>
- name: Print outputs
  run: |
    echo ${{ steps.my_step_id.outputs.id }}
    echo ${{ steps.my_step_id.outputs.number }}
    echo ${{ steps.my_step_id.outputs.status }}
```

## Inputs

| Name | Is required | Description |
|---|---|---|
|token|true|Token to authenticate the request
|owner|false|owner parameter
|repo|false|repo parameter
|message|true|The commit message
|tree|true|The SHA of the tree object this commit points to
|parents|true|The SHAs of the commits that were the parents of this commit. If omitted or empty, the commit will be written as a root commit. For a single parent, an array of one SHA should be provided; for a merge commit, an array of more than one should be provided.
|author|false|Information about the author of the commit. By default, the `author` will be the authenticated user and the current date. See the `author` and `committer` object below for details.
|committer|false|Information about the person who is making the commit. By default, `committer` will use the information set in `author`. See the `author` and `committer` object below for details.
|signature|false|The [PGP signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) of the commit. GitHub adds the signature to the `gpgsig` header of the created commit. For a commit signature to be verifiable by Git or GitHub, it must be an ASCII-armored detached PGP signature over the string commit as it would be written to the object database. To pass a `signature` parameter, you need to first manually create a valid PGP signature, which can be complicated. You may find it easier to [use the command line](https://git-scm.com/book/id/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work) to create signed commits.
|file_output|false|Path to store full output of the action
|custom_outputs|false|Custom outputs to create for step. This has to be YAML multiline string literal `custom_outputs: \|<newline> output_name:path.in.result`

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
|id|`id` field of the response (if exists)|
|number|`number` field of the response (if exists)|
|status|HTTP status of underlying API call|
