name: Create reaction for a team discussion (Legacy)
description: |
  **Deprecation Notice:** This endpoint route is deprecated and will be removed from the Teams API. We recommend migrating your existing code to use the new [`Create reaction for a team discussion`](https://developer.github.com/v3/reactions/#create-reaction-for-a-team-discussion) endpoint.  Create a reaction to a [team discussion](https://developer.github.com/v3/teams/discussions/). OAuth access tokens require the `write:discussion` [scope](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/understanding-scopes-for-oauth-apps/). A response with a `Status: 200 OK` means that you already added the reaction type to this team discussion.
