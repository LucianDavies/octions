A response with a `Status: 200 OK` means that you already added the reaction type to this team discussion comment.  **Note:** You can also specify a team by `org_id` and `team_id` using the route `POST /organizations/:org_id/team/:team_id/discussions/:discussion_number/comments/:comment_number/reactions`.
