name: Create a new authorization
description: |
  **Deprecation Notice:** GitHub will discontinue the [OAuth Authorizations API](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth_authorizations/), which is used by integrations to create personal access tokens and OAuth tokens, and you must now create these tokens using our [web application flow](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps/#web-application-flow). For more information, see the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2019-11-05-deprecated-passwords-and-authorizations-api).  **Warning:** Apps must use the [web application flow](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps/#web-application-flow) to obtain OAuth tokens that work with GitHub SAML organizations. OAuth tokens created using the Authorizations API will be unable to access GitHub SAML organizations. For more information, see the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2019-11-05-deprecated-passwords-and-authorizations-api).  Creates OAuth tokens using [Basic Authentication](https://developer.github.com/v3/auth#basic-authentication). If you have two-factor authentication setup, Basic Authentication for this endpoint requires that you use a one-time password (OTP) and your username and password instead of tokens. For more information, see "[Working with two-factor authentication](https://developer.github.com/v3/auth/#working-with-two-factor-authentication)."  To create tokens for a particular OAuth application using this endpoint, you must authenticate as the user you want to create an authorization for and provide the app's client ID and secret, found on your OAuth application's settings page. If your OAuth application intends to create multiple tokens for one user, use `fingerprint` to differentiate between them.  You can also create tokens on GitHub from the [personal access tokens settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens) page. Read more about these tokens in [the GitHub Help documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use).  Organizations that enforce SAML SSO require personal access tokens to be whitelisted. Read more about whitelisting tokens in [the GitHub Help documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/about-identity-and-access-management-with-saml-single-sign-on).
