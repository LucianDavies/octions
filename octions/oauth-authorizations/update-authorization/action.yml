name: Update an existing authorization
description: |
  **Deprecation Notice:** GitHub will discontinue the [OAuth Authorizations API](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth_authorizations/), which is used by integrations to create personal access tokens and OAuth tokens, and you must now create these tokens using our [web application flow](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps/#web-application-flow). The [OAuth Authorizations API](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth_authorizations/) will be removed on November, 13, 2020. For more information, including scheduled brownouts, see the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-14-deprecating-oauth-auth-endpoint/).  If you have two-factor authentication setup, Basic Authentication for this endpoint requires that you use a one-time password (OTP) and your username and password instead of tokens. For more information, see "[Working with two-factor authentication](https://developer.github.com/v3/auth/#working-with-two-factor-authentication)."  You can only send one of these scope keys at a time.
