name: Get-or-create an authorization for a specific app and fingerprint
description: |
  This method will create a new authorization for the specified OAuth application, only if an authorization for that application and fingerprint do not already exist for the user. The URL includes the 20 character client ID for the OAuth app that is requesting the token. `fingerprint` is a unique string to distinguish an authorization from others created for the same client ID and user. It returns the user's existing authorization for the application if one is present. Otherwise, it creates and returns a new one.  If you have two-factor authentication setup, Basic Authentication for this endpoint requires that you use a one-time password (OTP) and your username and password instead of tokens. For more information, see "[Working with two-factor authentication](https://developer.github.com/v3/auth/#working-with-two-factor-authentication)."
