name: List your organizations
description: |
  List organizations for the authenticated user.  **OAuth scope requirements**  This only lists organizations that your authorization allows you to operate on in some way (e.g., you can list teams with `read:org` scope, you can publicize your organization membership with `user` scope, etc.). Therefore, this API requires at least `user` or `read:org` scope. OAuth requests with insufficient scope receive a `403 Forbidden` response.
