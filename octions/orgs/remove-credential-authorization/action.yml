name: Remove a credential authorization for an organization
description: |
  Listing and deleting credential authorizations is available to organizations with GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see [GitHub's billing plans](https://help.github.com/articles/github-s-billing-plans) in the GitHub Help documentation.  An authenticated organization owner with the `admin:org` scope can remove a credential authorization for an organization that uses SAML SSO. Once you remove someone's credential authorization, they will need to create a new personal access token or SSH key and authorize it for the organization they want to access.
