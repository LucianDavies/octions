name: List credential authorizations for an organization
description: |
  Listing and deleting credential authorizations is available to organizations with GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see [GitHub's billing plans](https://help.github.com/articles/github-s-billing-plans) in the GitHub Help documentation.  An authenticated organization owner with the `read:org` scope can list all credential authorizations for an organization that uses SAML single sign-on (SSO). The credentials are either personal access tokens or SSH keys that organization members have authorized for the organization. For more information, see [About authentication with SAML single sign-on](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-authentication-with-saml-single-sign-on).
